# Implementation of Features


---
### ​Registration Page / Login Page
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- Firebase for Authentication    

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
Benefit is relying on Firebase to provide security measures, and having a simplified JWT structure that allows us to easily access authenticated user profiles.  There are also multiple ways to easily integrate other registration methods such as by phone number or using 3rd party accounts such as Github, Facebook, Google.  Cost is considering any 3rd party vendor lock-ins, and how it affects users if we needed to migrate to another auth provider.
